TO DO:
- Delete 5HQ2? It is only one half of nucleosome
- Make a tree graph with histones and their interacting partners
- Make a histogram interface residues

- Extract tetramers/hexamers (?)
- Redo pie charts/tables from 'report1.pdf' (PantherDB recognized only 19 UNIPROT#)
- Classify binding partners by protein family (conserved domain DB)
- Visualize interfaces

DONE:
- Checked extracted binding partners for known parnters from literature (from Seyit):
   *4QLC was missing (chromatosome)
   *added it to 'protein_ligands_merged.csv'

- Double-checked whether all binding partners were extracted
   *P0AEY0 was missing (Maltose-binding periplasmic protein)
   *Added it to the 'non_histone_chains.csv'

- Made a histogram with # of structures vs year
  *Cumulative sum plot looks better
