TO DO:
- Make a histogram of interface residues: 
  - Every line either a variant/binding partner or just variant
  - Merge together or add cryo EM using VAST+ 
  - Do something about variants
  - Normalize

- Visualize interfaces by binding partner
- Classify binding partners by protein family (conserved domain DB)
- Check histone/DNA and DNA/binding partner interfaces 
- Document scripts
- Extract tetramers/hexamers (?)
- Redo pie charts/tables from 'report1.pdf' (PantherDB recognized only 19 UNIPROT#)
