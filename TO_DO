1) Write a script to double-check whether all binding partners were extracted
2) Check extracted binding partners for known parnters from literature (from Seyit)
3) Redo pie charts/charts from report1.pdf (PantherDB recognized only 19 UNIPROT#)
4) Classify binding partners by protein family (conserved domain DB)
5) Get interfaces (how?)
