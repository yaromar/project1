TO DO:
- Redo pie charts/tables from 'report1.pdf' (PantherDB recognized only 19 UNIPROT#)
- Classify binding partners by protein family (conserved domain DB)
- Get interfaces (how?)

DONE:
- Checked extracted binding partners for known parnters from literature (from Seyit):
   *4QLC was missing (chromatosome)
   *added it to 'protein_ligands_merged.csv'

- Double-checked whether all binding partners were extracted
   *P0AEY0 was missing (Maltose-binding periplasmic protein)
   *Added it to the 'non_histone_chains.csv'
