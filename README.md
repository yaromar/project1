  nucleosomes_pdb:
 
    1) contains PDB# of all (16/7/18) resolved whole (8 chains) nucleosomes; 158 structures in total              
    2) 1 column: PDB
    3) the list can be obtained by completing the first step from 'notes_Y.txt'
    
  protein_ligand_merged.csv:
  
    1) contains all chains/nucleotides/ligands of the nucleosome structures from 'nucleosome_pdb'
    2) 15 columns: structureId, chainId, structureTitle, pdbDoi, entityId, ligandId, ligandName, InChI, InChIKey, hetId, IC50, deltaG, uniprotAcc, uniprotRecommendedName, uniprotAlternativeNames
    3) the file can be obtained by completing the second step from 'notes_Y.txt'(additional info can be added)
