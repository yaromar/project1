# PROJECT1
Characterizing Binding Partners/Spots of Nucleosomes


FILES:

  notes_Y.txt
  
    *tips/useful links/protocols

  nucleosomes_pdb:
 
    *contains PDB# of all (16/7/18) resolved whole (8 chains) nucleosomes and a structure of a chromatosome; 159 structures in total              
    *3 column: PDB, depositionDate, releaseDate
    *'Nucleosome_PDB' entity from the 'ER_diagram'
    *the list can be obtained by completing the first step from 'notes_Y.txt' and manually adding a structure of chromatosome
    
  protein_ligand_merged.csv:
  
    *contains all chains/nucleotides/ligands of the nucleosome structures from 'nucleosome_pdb'
    *15 columns: structureId, chainId, structureTitle, pdbDoi, entityId, ligandId, ligandName, InChI, InChIKey, hetId, IC50, deltaG, uniprotAcc, uniprotRecommendedName, uniprotAlternativeNames
    *merged 'Histone' and 'Molecule' entities from 'ER_diagram
    *the file can be obtained by completing the second step from 'notes_Y.txt'(additional info can be added)
      
  non_histone_chains.tsv:
  
    *contains UNIPROT# of chains that are not histones found in the PDB structures from 'nucleosome_pdb'
    *9 columns: UNIPROT,	PDB,	binding_partner_name,	PDB_name,	nucleosome_Organism,	binding_parner_organism, notes, CD_results, deposit_year, release_year
    *there are 31 unique chains in total (if we count centromere protein N in 6C0W and 6BUZ), but 38 entries, as some of the binding partners occur in several PDB structures; also, 6FML's chain G is actually a catalytic domain of INO80 (Ino80), but it does not have a UNIPROT -- I distinguish it from INO80 complex subunit B of 6ETX for now (it aligned with RMSD 3.46 2646 atoms)
    *there are only 20 PDB structures that contain binding partners; also, 6C0W is bound only to centromere protein N, while 6BUZ's binding partner is the same chain as centromere protein N
    
  small_molecules.txt:
  
    *contains ligand names of small molecules found in the PDB structures from 'nucleosome_pdb'
    *1 column: ligandName
    *there are 31 small molecules in total
    *some of them might not bind to nucleosome core particles (e.g., bind to binding partners)
  
  report_1.pdf:
  
    *names of unique binding partner chains extracted from 'protein_ligand_merged.csv' (manually! 30 in total; 1 missing in the report)
    *names of unique small molecules extracted from 'protein_ligand_merged.csv' (manually! omitting ions! 30 in total; 1 missing in the report)
    *tables are from the PIR server, pie charts from the PantherDB 
    *PantherDB recognized only 19 UNIPROT
    
  Interfaces/:
  
    *contains results of Alexander's pipeline for PDB structures that contain binding partners
    
  PDB_release_trend*.tsv:
  
    *contains data on years/pdb_structures for histograms in Images/'PDB_release_trends.png'
    *5 columns: YEAR, nucleosome_W/_BP, nucleosome_w/bp_cumulative, NUCLEOSOME_ONLY, NUCLEOSOME_ONLY_CUMULATIVE
    
SCRIPTS:

  getpdb.sh:
  
    *downloads a specified PDB to a specified folder (downloads to the current folder by default)
    *usage: getpdb 'PDB#' [directory]
    
  interface_to_frequency.*:
  
    *converts interface data obtained by Alex to residue frequency
    *uses *chain_protein_mapping.tab files and labeled_chains.tsv
    *usage: to be determined
